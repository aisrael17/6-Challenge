# 6-Challenge
Challenge 6 for the Columbia FinTech Bootcamp

## Technologies
For this project, I used Python 3 and the following external libraries:

* pandas
* hvplot
* pathlib

## Data
For this project, I used neighborhood census data in San Francisco from 2010-2016 tracking:

* Neighborhood
* Sale Price Per Square Foot
* # of Housing Units 
* Gross Rent

## Project Description
This project had many different parts. The focus was on manipulating the aforementioned data in different ways and then plotting that data using the hvplot library. 

First, we calculated and plotted the aggregate housing units, sale price per square foot, and gross rent over time. Next, we created a widget allowing us to graph sale price per square food and gross rent over time by neighborhood. However, the gross rent in the provided data is the same for each neighborhood within a given year. Finally, we built an interactive neighborhood map allowing us to visualize the rent data on a map.
